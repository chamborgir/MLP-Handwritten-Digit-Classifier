MLP Handwritten Digit Classifier

Mulilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is a type of feedforward neural network, can be effectively used for digit classification tasks like recognizing handwritten digits from datasets like MNIST, by learning complex, nonlinear patterns.

This python program uses an MLP model to classify handwritten digit using MNIST Dataset. 
The model trains 28x28, 2D, 60k raw images with labels and tests with 10k raw images, then displays the predicted and actual label.

How does this model work:
1. It Preprocesses and loads the MNIST Dataset
2. Flattens the 2D image to 1D vector
3. Define, compile, and train the MLP model
4. Evaluates the model's accuracy
5. Displays the tested images using pyplot
 
Soon to add:
* User Input Handwritten using Tkinter.
* Test with other dataset and compare accuracy.
